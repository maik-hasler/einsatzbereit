## Adding a Feature (canonical pattern)

```
1. Domain (if domain logic involved)
   └── Domain/Organizations/Organization.cs  - add method

2. Application
   └── Application/Organizations/{UseCase}/v1/
       ├── {UseCase}Command.cs / {UseCase}Query.cs
       └── {UseCase}CommandHandler.cs / {UseCase}QueryHandler.cs

3. Api
   └── Api/Organizations/{UseCase}/v1/
       ├── {UseCase}Request.cs    - request body record (omit if no body)
       └── {UseCase}Endpoint.cs  - implements IEndpoint, maps route, calls ISender

4. OpenAPI regenerates automatically on dotnet build (NSwag in Api.csproj), which regenerates `api-client.ts` in turn
```

Reference implementations (newest first): `Organizations/RemoveMember/`, `Organizations/GetOrganizationDetails/`.

## Key Patterns

### IEndpoint auto-discovery
Any class implementing `IEndpoint` is auto-registered via `Api/Common/Endpoints/EndpointExtensions.cs` (assembly scan into DI) and mapped under the versioned route group that `EndpointExtensions.MapEndpoints` builds once (`v{version:apiVersion}`) - individual endpoints map their own path relative to that group, they don't repeat the version prefix themselves. `Api/Organizations/RemoveMember/v1/RemoveMemberEndpoint.cs` is a real, current example: route mapping, auth policy, rate limiting, and CQRS dispatch all in one file.

### CQRS dispatch
`ISender.Send(request, cancellationToken)` (`Application/Common/Messaging/ISender.cs`) from the endpoint handler, e.g. `await sender.Send(command, cancellationToken)` in `RemoveMemberEndpoint.cs` above.

### Handler registration
Auto-scanned from Application assembly - no manual DI registration needed.  
Add a class implementing `ICommandHandler<,>` or `IQueryHandler<,>` and it's picked up.

### Error handling (Result pattern)
Domain and Application logic signals failure with `Result`/`Result<T>` (`Domain/Primitives/Result.cs`), not exceptions. A domain method that can fail returns `Result` (or `Result<T>` when it also produces a value) built from `Error.Validation/NotFound/Conflict/Forbidden(code, description)` - see `Domain/Engagements/Engagement.cs`'s `Confirm()`/`Cancel()` for real, current examples, including the `IsAnonymized` guard every mutating method on `Engagement` starts with.

Command/query handlers convert a `Result` to an exception at the Application boundary with `Application/Common/Exceptions/ResultExtensions.cs`:
- `result.ThrowIfFailure()` for a plain `Result`
- `result.GetValueOrThrow()` for a `Result<T>`, returning `T` on success

Both throw `ResultFailureException(Error)`, caught by `Api/Common/ExceptionHandlers/ResultFailureExceptionHandler.cs` and mapped to a `ProblemDetails` response (`Validation`->400, `NotFound`->404, `Conflict`->409, `Forbidden`->403) with `errorCode` + `traceId`. Only use this Application-boundary throw; don't invent a second convention for new endpoints, and don't thread `Result` all the way to the endpoint layer.

### Domain events
Aggregates raise events via `AddEvent(...)` (see `EngagementConfirmedDomainEvent` etc. in `Domain/Engagements/`). Dispatch is transactional-outbox based (#828), not direct:

1. `Infrastructure/Persistence/Interceptors/ConvertDomainEventsToOutboxMessagesInterceptor.cs` collects an aggregate's events during `SavingChangesAsync` (before the write) and converts each into an `OutboxMessage` row (`Infrastructure/Persistence/Outbox/OutboxMessage.cs`) added to the same `DbContext` - so it's part of the *same* DB transaction as the triggering command, all-or-nothing.
2. `Infrastructure/BackgroundJobs/OutboxProcessorJob.cs` polls for unprocessed `OutboxMessage` rows on its own timer, in its own DI scope/DbContext, well after the triggering command's transaction has committed. It deserializes each message back to a `DomainEvent` and calls `IDomainEventDispatcher.DispatchAsync`, which invokes `IPublisher`/`Publisher` -> the registered `INotificationHandler<T>`(s).

Because dispatch now happens in a fresh scope after commit (not inline inside the triggering `SaveChangesAsync`), an `INotificationHandler<T>` **can** safely call `ISender.Send(...)` or write through its own injected `IApplicationDbContext` - there's no outer open transaction to conflict with.

### Pipeline behaviors (run in this order)
1. `TransactionPipelineBehavior` - wraps commands in a DB transaction
2. `PerformancePipelineBehavior` - logs slow requests

### Authorization policies
| Policy constant | Role |
|---|---|
| `EinsatzbereitAdminPolicy` | `admin` |
| `EinsatzbereitDefaultUserPolicy` | `user` |
| `EinsatzbereitOrganisatorPolicy` | `organisator` |

## Organization domain model

`Organization` aggregate fields: `Id`, `Name`, `Description?`, `ContactEmail?`, `ContactPhone?`, `Website?`, `Address?` (`Domain.Common.Address`), `CreatedOn`, `ModifiedOn`.

`IKeycloakOrganizationService` methods: `CreateOrganizationAsync`, `AddMemberAsync`, `RemoveMemberAsync`, `AssignOrganizerRoleAsync`, `GetMembersAsync`, `SearchUsersAsync`, `DeleteOrganizationAsync`. Which organizations a user organizes is answered from the local `organization_membership` table (`IApplicationDbContext.GetOrganizerOrganizationsAsync`), not Keycloak.

## Implemented endpoints (Organizations)

| Method | Route | Auth | Handler |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/v1/organizations` | DefaultUser | `GetOrganizations` |
| POST | `/v1/organizations` | DefaultUser | `CreateOrganization` |
| GET | `/v1/organizations/{id}` | Organisator | `GetOrganizationDetails` |
| PUT | `/v1/organizations/{id}` | Organisator | `UpdateOrganization` |
| DELETE | `/v1/organizations/{id}/members/{userId}` | Organisator | `RemoveMember` |

## Database

- `UseSnakeCaseNamingConvention()`
- Migrations in `Infrastructure/Persistence/Migrations/`
- Add migration: `dotnet ef migrations add <Name> -p src/Infrastructure -s src/Api`
- Apply migrations: runs automatically on startup in Development; `dotnet ef database update` otherwise

## Testing

### Unit tests (`Application.UnitTests`)
- Mock with NSubstitute, assert with AwesomeAssertions
- Test handlers in isolation - no DB, no HTTP

### Integration tests (`IntegrationTests`)
- `IntegrationTestFixture` (IAsyncLifetime): spins up Postgres + Keycloak containers
- `Respawn` resets database state between tests (not between runs)
- `ApiClient.cs` is NSwag-generated - **do not hand-edit**
- Get auth tokens via `GetAccessTokenAsync(username, password)` in fixture

### Architecture tests (`ArchitectureTests`)
- `ArchitectureLayerTests.cs` - layer dependency rules
- `EndpointConventionTests.cs` - endpoint naming/structure rules
- `MessagingConventionTests.cs` - handler/command/query naming rules
- Run these if you rename namespaces or move files between layers

### Visual tests (`VisualTests`)
- TUnit.Playwright + Aspire: boots the full stack (Postgres, Keycloak, backend API, frontend) and drives it through a real browser - E2E flows plus axe-core a11y checks
- Still the slowest suite, and the one to think twice before adding to: #2148 moved 152 cases out of it into Vitest/RTL and `IntegrationTests`, and the ~390 that remain are there because they genuinely need a browser (rendered layout, real input, a real Keycloak round trip, a page-level axe scan). Before writing a new case here, check whether the assertion needs any of those - see `docs/TDRs/2_slow_ci_pipeline.adoc` for the per-case breakdown. Sharded across four jobs in `dotnet.yml`
- `AccessibilityTests.cs` - the **page-level** axe-core gate: one scan per distinct layout/palette plus the handful of assertions that need a real browser (skip-link focus, the Leaflet marker's accessible name, tab order). Component-level scans live in `frontend/src/**/*.a11y.test.tsx` under `vitest-axe` (#2148) - add a case *here* for a new route, and a component suite *there* for a new component or component state. See the class summary for the full division of labour
- `AuthHelper.cs` - `LoginAsync` drives the real Keycloak login UI; `FastSignInAsync` seeds a minted token straight into `localStorage` to skip the redirect round trip for tests that only need an authenticated session as a precondition
- Root `AGENTS.md`'s "Mandatory: Deploy and verify" flow requires a matching assertion here for every bug fix/feature - see step 6

### Mutation testing (`Stryker.NET`, manual)

Report-only, never a merge gate (#2147). Exists as the falsifiable guardrail for the E2E rebalance (#2148): record the score, move a wave of `VisualTests` cases down the pyramid, re-run - if the score held, the coverage that was removed was redundant. Line coverage cannot answer that question, because a deleted redundant test and a deleted load-bearing one look identical to it.

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-stryker --version 4.16.0
cd backend/tests/Application.UnitTests
dotnet-stryker --project Domain.csproj
dotnet-stryker --project Application.csproj
```

- **Run from `tests/Application.UnitTests/`, not from `backend/`.** Stryker picks up `stryker-config.json` from the working directory, and from `backend/` it finds `Einsatzbereit.slnx`, switches to solution mode, and tries to build the whole solution - which drags in `VisualTests` and its ~290 MiB Playwright browser download for a run that never opens a browser.
- **`test-runner: mtp` is mandatory** and is set in `stryker-config.json`. Stryker's default VSTest runner discovers zero tests against TUnit (Microsoft.Testing.Platform only, no VSTest adapter) and reports a vacuous pass. The MTP runner is still marked preview by Stryker and says so on every run.
- **`concurrency: 1` is load-bearing, not a performance setting.** That preview MTP runner miscounts above concurrency 1: 30-73 kills per run that concurrency 1 does not report, never the reverse, and a different subset each time. The score comes out ~5 points high and moves ~1 point between identical runs, which makes it useless as a before/after guardrail. At concurrency 1 two runs at the same commit are bit-for-bit identical. Do not raise it.
- **`Application.UnitTests.csproj` references `Domain.csproj` directly** purely so `--project Domain.csproj` resolves - Stryker only matches the project to mutate against the *direct* ProjectReference list. It is redundant to the compiler; see the comment in the csproj.
- Recorded baseline (`Domain` 66.75 %, `Application` 68.49 %, combined 67.89 % at commit `c4a143b`), wall-clock (~4 min + ~8 min), and how to read the number: `docs/TDRs/2_slow_ci_pipeline.adoc`. CI equivalent: `.github/workflows/mutation-tests.yml` (`workflow_dispatch` only).

### Run all tests
TUnit uses Microsoft.Testing.Platform, not the `dotnet test` new testing
experience - run each project directly, the same way CI does:
```bash
# from backend/
dotnet run --project tests/Application.UnitTests
dotnet run --project tests/ArchitectureTests
dotnet run --project tests/IntegrationTests
dotnet run --project tests/VisualTests
```
