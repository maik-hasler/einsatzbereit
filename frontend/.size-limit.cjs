/**
 * Byte budgets, measured against `pnpm build` and enforced by `pnpm size`.
 *
 * Every limit below is the size measured when the budget was introduced plus
 * roughly five per cent of headroom, rounded up to a whole kilobyte. That makes
 * this a ratchet, not an aspiration: a change that grows a chunk by more than
 * its slack has to say so in the diff, and a change that shrinks one should
 * lower the number in the same commit so the slack does not quietly accumulate.
 *
 * All sizes are gzipped, because that is what crosses the wire - nginx serves
 * the precompressed `.gz` siblings vite-plugin-compression2 emits
 * (`check:nginx-gzip-static` guards the wiring).
 *
 * The one entry that grew rather than shrank when these were introduced is the
 * first load, by about 10 kB: that is TanStack Query, and ADR-9 argues the
 * trade. Everything else moved the other way - the organizer dashboard from
 * 76 kB to 12, the administration area from one 6.3 kB chunk to a 0.6 kB shell
 * plus the one tab the visitor opened.
 *
 * "First load" is not a guess: it is exactly the set VitePWA precaches
 * (`workbox.globPatterns` in vite.config.ts - index/vendor JS plus the single
 * stylesheet `cssCodeSplit: false` produces), which is what a visitor
 * downloads before any route chunk is fetched.
