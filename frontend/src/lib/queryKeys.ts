/**
 * Every query key the app uses, in one place.
 *
 * A key is what connects a mutation to the queries it invalidates, and those
 * two are always written in different files. Spelling them inline means the
 * connection is a string literal that has to match, with nothing to catch it
 * when one side is renamed - so they live here, as functions, and the compiler
 * checks the arguments.
 *
 * The shape is hierarchical on purpose: `queryKeys.organizations.all` is a
 * prefix of `queryKeys.organizations.detail(id)`, so invalidating the former
 * invalidates every organization query, including ones added later.
