# The Content-Security-Policy's connect-src/frame-src need the backend API
# and Keycloak origins (scheme+host, no path), derived from the same env vars
# as config.js above rather than hardcoded, so whoever runs this image is not
# silently locked to somebody else's origins. img-src additionally needs the
# MinIO storage origin (STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL, matching
# the backend's Storage__PublicEndpoint) since uploaded org logos/opportunity
# banners/avatars are served from there, not from the API origin. Unlike the
# three required above, STORAGE_PUBLIC_URL keeps a fallback: a missing value
# only narrows the CSP's img-src (broken images, loudly visible), not an
# origin that silently swallows every API call and login.
